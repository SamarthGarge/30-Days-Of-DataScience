## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Linear Regression?

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict a target variable (dependent variable) based on one or more input variables (independent variables). The goal is to establish a linear relationship between the variables.



### Equation of Linear Regression

The equation of a simple linear regression line is:

**y = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅx + Œµ**

- **y**: Predicted value (target).
- **Œ≤‚ÇÄ**: Intercept.
- **Œ≤‚ÇÅ**: Coefficient (slope).
- **x**: Input variable (feature).
- **Œµ**: Error term.

For multiple linear regression:

**y = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅx‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇx‚ÇÇ + ... + Œ≤‚Çôx‚Çô + Œµ**



### Use Cases of Linear Regression

- Predicting house prices.
- Estimating sales figures.
- Analyzing the impact of marketing spend.
- Forecasting demand.



## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Linear Regression in Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn provides a ready-to-use implementation of Linear Regression through the `LinearRegression` class. Let‚Äôs go step by step.



### Dataset Overview

We‚Äôll use a sample dataset from Scikit-learn‚Äôs `datasets` module or custom data to understand Linear Regression.



### Steps to Implement Linear Regression

1. Import required libraries.
2. Load and explore the dataset.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Train the Linear Regression model using the training data.
5. Make predictions using the testing data.
6. Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.



## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Code Implementation

### 1. Importing Libraries

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
```



### 2. Loading and Exploring the Dataset

We use Scikit-learn‚Äôs `load_diabetes` dataset as an example.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes

# Load dataset
data = load_diabetes()
df = pd.DataFrame(data.data, columns=data.feature_names)
df['target'] = data.target

# Explore the data
print(df.head())
```



### 3. Preparing the Data

```python
# Features and target variable
X = df.drop(columns=['target'])
y = df['target']

# Splitting data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```



### 4. Training the Model

```python
# Initialize the model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Model trained successfully!")
```



### 5. Making Predictions

```python
# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Display first five predictions
print("Predictions:", y_pred[:5])
```



### 6. Model Evaluation

```python
# Mean Squared Error (MSE)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

# R-squared Score
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"R-squared Score: {r2}")
```



## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Practice Exercises

1. Load a custom dataset and implement Linear Regression.
2. Try normalizing the data before training the model‚Äîdoes it improve the performance?
3. Evaluate your model using additional metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE).



## üåü Summary

- Linear Regression models a linear relationship between input and output variables.
- Scikit-learn provides an easy-to-use interface to train and evaluate regression models.
- Key metrics like MSE and R-squared help assess model performance.
