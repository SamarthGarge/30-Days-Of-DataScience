## üåü Introduction to Big Data

Big Data refers to data that is so large, fast, or complex that traditional data processing methods cannot efficiently process it. Key characteristics include:

- **Volume**: Huge amounts of data.
- **Velocity**: High speed at which data is generated.
- **Variety**: Different forms like structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data.



## üî• What is Apache Spark?

**Apache Spark** is an open-source, distributed computing system designed for fast and scalable processing of large datasets. Key features include:

- **Speed**: Processes data 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce.
- **Ease of Use**: APIs in Python, Java, Scala, and R.
- **Versatility**: Supports SQL, streaming, machine learning, and graph processing.



## üêç Why PySpark?

PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark. It allows Python developers to leverage Spark's distributed computing capabilities with Pythonic simplicity.

- Easy to learn for Python developers.
- Integrates seamlessly with Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy.



## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up PySpark

### Installation

To install PySpark, use pip:

```bash
pip install pyspark
```

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK). Spark requires Java 8 or higher.
2. Verify the installation:

```bash
java -version
```

3. Launch PySpark from the terminal:

```bash
pyspark
```



## üìù PySpark Basics

### Creating an RDD

An **RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)** is the fundamental data structure in Spark. You can create an RDD in PySpark as follows:

```python
from pyspark import SparkContext

# Initialize SparkContext
sc = SparkContext("local", "Day 29 Example")

# Create an RDD
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
rdd = sc.parallelize(data)

print("RDD Elements:", rdd.collect())
```

### Transformations and Actions

- **Transformations** create a new RDD from an existing one. Examples: `map`, `filter`.
- **Actions** perform operations and return results. Examples: `collect`, `count`.

#### Example: Map and Filter

```python
# Transformation: Map
squared_rdd = rdd.map(lambda x: x ** 2)

# Transformation: Filter
filtered_rdd = squared_rdd.filter(lambda x: x > 10)

# Action: Collect
result = filtered_rdd.collect()
print("Filtered Result:", result)
```

#### Example: Reduce

```python
# Action: Reduce
sum_result = rdd.reduce(lambda x, y: x + y)
print("Sum of RDD Elements:", sum_result)
```



## üìÅ Partitioning in Big Data

Partitioning refers to splitting data into smaller chunks to be processed in parallel. In PySpark, partitioning is essential for optimizing performance.

### Example: Partitioning Data

```python
# Create an RDD with 4 partitions
partitioned_rdd = sc.parallelize(data, 4)
print("Number of Partitions:", partitioned_rdd.getNumPartitions())
```

### Repartitioning

You can repartition an RDD to increase or decrease the number of partitions.

```python
# Repartitioning
repartitioned_rdd = partitioned_rdd.repartition(2)
print("New Number of Partitions:", repartitioned_rdd.getNumPartitions())
```



## üìâ Handling Missing Data in Big Data

Big Data often contains missing or null values. PySpark provides tools to handle missing data efficiently.

### Example: Handling Null Values in a DataFrame

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("MissingDataExample").getOrCreate()

# Create a DataFrame with missing values
data = [("Alice", 34), (None, 29), ("Bob", None)]
columns = ["Name", "Age"]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)

# Drop rows with null values
df_cleaned = df.dropna()
df_cleaned.show()
```

### Filling Missing Values

```python
# Fill missing values with a default
df_filled = df.fillna({"Name": "Unknown", "Age": 0})
df_filled.show()
```



## üí° Practice Exercise

**Task**: Using PySpark, create an RDD and perform the following:

1. Partition the RDD into 3 partitions.
2. Apply a transformation to multiply each element by 10.
3. Filter the elements greater than 20.
4. Collect the results.



## üìú Summary

Today, we explored:

- The fundamentals of **Big Data** and its challenges.
- **PySpark Basics**, including RDD creation and transformations.
- **Partitioning** for efficient data processing.
- **Handling Missing Data** in PySpark.
