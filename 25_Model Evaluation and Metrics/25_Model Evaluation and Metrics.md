# 📊 Day 25 - Model Evaluation and Metrics

Welcome to **Day 25** of the **30 Days of Data Science** series! 🎉 Today, we will dive into the critical topic of **Model Evaluation and Metrics**. Understanding how to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model is essential to ensure its effectiveness and reliability in real-world scenarios. Let's explore topics like **Confusion Matrix** and **ROC-AUC Curve** with hands-on examples! 🚀

## 🔍 Introduction to Model Evaluation

Model evaluation is a crucial step in machine learning to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. The goal is to evaluate both the predictive power and robustness of a model using appropriate metrics.

Evaluation often involves splitting data into **training** and **test sets** or employing **cross-validation** techniques. Some common evaluation metrics include:

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: Useful for imbalanced datasets.
- **ROC-AUC**: Measures a model's ability to distinguish between classes.

In this section, we'll focus on two widely-used tools for model evaluation: **Confusion Matrix** and **ROC-AUC Curve**.



## 📉 Confusion Matrix

A **Confusion Matrix** is a tabular representation of actual versus predicted classifications. It is used to visualize the performance of classification models. The matrix contains four key components:

|                | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Actual Positive** | True Positive (TP)     | False Negative (FN)     |
| **Actual Negative** | False Positive (FP)    | True Negative (TN)      |

### 🔢 Key Metrics Derived from the Confusion Matrix

1. **Accuracy**:  
   Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)

2. **Precision**: Measures the accuracy of positive predictions.  
   Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

3. **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Measures the ability to detect positive samples.  
   Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

4. **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.  
   F1 = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)



### Example: Confusion Matrix in Scikit-Learn

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load dataset and split
data = load_iris()
X, y = data.data, data.target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Confusion Matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", cm)

# Classification Report
print("\nClassification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```



## 📈 ROC and AUC

The **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve** and the **Area Under the Curve (AUC)** are used to evaluate the performance of binary classification models. The ROC curve plots:

- **True Positive Rate (TPR)** (Sensitivity) on the Y-axis.
- **False Positive Rate (FPR)** on the X-axis.

The **AUC** provides a single scalar value to summarize the ROC curve. A model with an AUC of **1.0** indicates perfect classification, while **0.5** suggests random guessing.

### Example: Plotting ROC-AUC in Scikit-Learn

```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Train binary classifier
binary_model = LogisticRegression()
binary_model.fit(X_train, y_train == 1)  # Simplify to binary classification

# Get predicted probabilities
y_probs = binary_model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

# Calculate ROC curve
fpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(y_test == 1, y_probs)
roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)

# Plot ROC Curve
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='blue', label=f"ROC Curve (AUC = {roc_auc:.2f})")
plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='red', linestyle='--')
plt.xlabel("False Positive Rate")
plt.ylabel("True Positive Rate")
plt.title("ROC Curve")
plt.legend(loc="lower right")
plt.show()
```



## 📚 Practice Exercises

1. Load a dataset of your choice and split it into training and test sets.
2. Train a classification model and compute the confusion matrix.
3. Use scikit-learn to plot the ROC curve and calculate the AUC for a binary classification task.
